Driver Drowsiness Detection using CNN
Detect and prevent driver drowsiness in real-time with this Python-based project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Drowsy driving is a significant safety concern, and this project aims to enhance road safety by monitoring the driver's behavior through a CNN-based approach, issuing alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of the driver's facial features through webcam access.
CNN Model: Utilize a Convolutional Neural Network for accurate and robust drowsiness detection.
Alert System: Visual and audible alerts to notify the driver when drowsiness is identified.
